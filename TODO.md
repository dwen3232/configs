# TODOS

- Set up treesitter
- Set up lspsaga (need unmap a bunch of stuff already mapped to <leader>c)
- Set up code folding  (nvim-ufo)
- Set up tests (neotest?)
- Set up debugger
- Set up linters/formatters to use .venv executables if available (prefer_local not working for some reason)


# BACKLOG
- Migrate from none-ls to an alternative. Maybe guard.nvim?
- Why is the which-key prefix for <leader>c not working? Very strange...
- Add GPG support for vim-fugitive https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/issues/846
- Refactor to use lsp-zero
- Add neotest
