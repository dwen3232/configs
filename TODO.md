# TODOS

- Set up treesitter
- Set up lspsaga (need unmap a bunch of stuff already mapped to <leader>c)


# BACKLOG
- Migrate from none-ls to an alternative. Maybe guard.nvim?
- Why is the which-key prefix for <leader>c not working? Very strange...
- Add GPG support for vim-fugitive https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/issues/846
