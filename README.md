# My Dotfiles
Just some configs for things I like to use


# TODOS
- Setup direnv and add .zshrc file
- Save open buffer state after :qa
- Add window management keybinds
- Figure out issues with conflicting keymaps (see which-key's checkhealth)
- Enhance debugger (switch to lua api, add more functionality)
