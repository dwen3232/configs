# My Configs
Just some configs for things I like to use

# TODOS
- Save open buffer state after :qa
- Add window management keybinds
- Add git submodules for tmux plugins
- My .gitignore is being strange, figure out why
- Figure out issues with conflicting keymaps (see which-key's checkhealth)
- Enhance debugger (switch to lua api, add more functionality)
