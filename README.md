# My Configs

Just some configs for things I like to use

# TODOS
- Set up debugger (only partially setup now)
- My .gitignore is being strange, figure out why
- Save open buffer state after :qa

# BACKLOG
- Add GPG support for vim-fugitive https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/issues/846
- Configure LSP/Linter/Formatter for other languages (Docker?)
