# My Configs
Just some configs for things I like to use

# TODOS
- Set up debugger (only partially setup now)
- Save open buffer state after :qa
- Add window management keybinds

# BACKLOG
- Review Lazy profile and plugin events (maybe more things can be async loaded?)
- My .gitignore is being strange, figure out why
- Figure out issues with conflicting keymaps (see which-key's checkhealth)
